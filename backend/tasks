1- Code Deployment and Server Management:
    - Make controller data real-time using a real-time database
    - Delete old data automatically
    - move data from redis_numbers table to history every two day if still use this table
    - get available 1 as price_out, need to be dynamic , (need to edit country_stats to set application and application code and price)
    - download no-sms numbers from box
    - show users and admin ip log with country in admin super page ==> TA []

2- Database Management:
    - Replace redis_numbers MySQL table with a Redis table (we move all redis_numbers to redis db but fe facing problem with get the count all requested and has sms numbers from redis. it's take tooooo times so we still tell now in mysql)
    - remove all unused tables    

3- Security:
    - remove all uneed files from administrationAccess and all the project
    - Change SSH port and server passwords
    - After enabling callbackurl, add a URL checker that checks URL availability to disable the account in case of problems with the URL
    - ip logger for admin login (add table in db add column for distination panel log both panel[adminAccess-controller]) ==> Ta
    - Set monitor for Redis performance
    

4- Messaging and Callbacks:
    - Add receive SMS to Redis for sending to users using a callback URL
    - Add live log to the controller like https://sms.goonline.company/stats/tailer.php
    - Add request number to the controller page (the ability to request a test number from the controller panel)
    
5- Code Editing and Procedure Modification:
    - Check this view https://activatecode.org/controller/country/Box_info2.php


6- Redis Integration:
    - Reactivate from Redis number
    - Move history log to Redis server
    - Move check service to Redis
    - Move requests log to Redis
    - Move balance into Redis server


7- Standardization and Optimization:
    - Force all to use getbulk_numbers
    - Setup a Telegram bot for server load and error handling events for Nginx, MySQL, Redis
